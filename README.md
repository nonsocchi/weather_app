## Clima Weather App
A simple weather app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Clima uses [Asynchronous programming in Dart](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await) to carry out time consuming tasks such as:
- Getting device location.
- Networking to get data from the internet.

This weather app is able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city!🌥️🏙️
